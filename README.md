Coding Challenge Entry: Cody M Leff
===========================================================

This implementation is written in Python.  It can be executed by running the run.sh shell script or by executing features.py from the command line in the python environment with the correct arguments, like so:

	python features.py [source file] [feature 1 output] [feature 2 output]

To prioritize scaling abilities, this implementation invokes few external libraries and avoids calls that involve iterating over internal storage as much as possible.
